1) Playbook and role to deploy multiple vSphere virtual machines from a template using Ansible

steps: 

Edit the vms-to-deploy file to define the number of virtual machines you want to deploy, as well as their template.
now run belwo command
# ansible-playbook -i vms-to-deploy deploy-qa.yml


VMWare guest module information 
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/vmware_guest_module.html

You should create a group_var file in order to set the variables that don't usually change in order to simplify playbook file, such as

vsphere_host, the address/hostname of the vcenter server
vsphere_user, a username with enough vSphere privileges to create VMs from templates
vsphere_datacenter, the vSphere datacenter name
vsphere_folder, the folder where to drop VM ("/TO_DEPLOY" for ex.)
guest_network, guest_netmask, guest_gateway, guest_dns_server, guest_domain_name, the usual network informations for your VMs
guest_id depending on the OS you want to deploy
guest_memory and guest_vcpu for your VM sizing
guest_template, the template name to copy the VM from
vsphere_host, vsphere_user (usualy I use a group_var/mygroup/main.yml file, group being declared in hosts_to_deploy inventory file)
Then you should create a hosts_to_deploy file that will be a temporary inventory file to store the hostname to deploy, and add them inside this group.

Examples of theses files can be found inside this repository, under group_vars/example_group.yml and hosts_to_deploy.

Execution
Don't forget the vmware_guest variables that already are playbook variables such as

notes, vsphere_password, esxi_host (prompted by playbook)
creationdate (automatically created)
vsphere_datastore, guest_custom_ip (usualy I put these as variables of the host in a hosts_to_deploy file)
